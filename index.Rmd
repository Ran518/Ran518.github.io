# Making Plots!

The website also contains plots about the data from instacartis which is an online grocery service that allows people to shop online from local stores. The first <strong> bar plot </strong> shows the number of items ordered in each aisle where more than 10000 items ordered. The second <strong> boxplot </strong>indicates the number of orders in each day of week. And the last <strong>scatter plot </strong> shows the number of orders in each hour of the day.
